JetSet Install Profile for Drupal
==================================

For full details of this project, please see README.txt, or the project area at:
http://atc.pilotinternet.com/jetset


===== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =====

REQUIREMENTS
============
To install JetSet you need Drush and Drush_make on your server or localhost.
Information on these projects and instructions to install them can be found at:
http://drupal.org/project/drush
http://drupal.org/project/drush_make

We also recommend using JetSet under Aegir - using JetSet to create a
'platform' that Aegir then manages and creates sites on.

INSTALLATION
============
Navigate to the directory where you would like to build your JetSet platform
and run the following command:

drush make http://github.com/pilotinternet/jetset/raw/master/jetset_build.make jetset

alternately, you can run:
wget http://github.com/pilotinternet/jetset/raw/master/jetset_build.make

Then making any changes you wish to make (eg enabling the jetdocs, using
vanilla Drupal instead of Pressflow etc), and then run:
drush make jetset_build.make jetset
