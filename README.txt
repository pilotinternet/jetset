JetSet Install Profile

by Steve Parks (steve.parks@pilotinternet.com)

===============================================================================

JetSet is a complete social media platform aimd at companies and membership
organisations.
It's built on Drupal, the open source content management system.



CUSTOMISATION
=============
This install profile has been designed in a way that makes it easily
customisable for your needs.
All customisations should be made to the include files in the 'includes'
directory. For full details, please see the README.txt file there.


WARNING
=======
A new site deployed on JetSet is suitable for a Drupal developer to begin
working on - not for clients or end users to access. It's best not to put it on
a production server until you have configured it fully, customised it, and
secured it. For example, you'll need to remove all the test users that are
set up, or at least change their passwords.


INSTALLATION
============
Please see the INSTALL.txt file included with the project.


IMPROVING JETSET
=================
We're always looking to improve JetSet, so please do contribute back to
the project any of the following:

1. Feedback on any clashes between modules, or particular versions of modules.
2. Any new ideas for settings we could include in the initial configuration
   that JetSet performs.
3. Nominations for modules, themes, patches or libraries to be removed or
   added.
4. Other improvements.

Please open a ticket, or contribute to an existing ticket, in the casetracker
at http://atc.pilotinternet.com/jetset. ATC stands for Air Traffic Control,
and is where we keep track of all projects.


CREDITS
=======
I studied the install profiles and makefiles of Open Atrium by Development Seed,
and Open Publish by Phase2. I also liberally borrowed code from each project.
Thanks go to all developers involved, and to the two awesome companies.
